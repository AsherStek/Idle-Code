# Idle Code

## Main Loop

    - Click to "Debug" programs
    - Programs have a certain amount of "bugs" (Health)
    - Every program has a deadline (Time limit) to Debug
    - When you debug a program you get paid.
    - Using that money you can buy upgrades such as code
    - Using these upgrades you can make small programs to increase click efficeny and make auto clickers
    - After a point you can choose to "Find a new company" (Accension)

## Code/Auto Clickers

    As the player continues throughout the game they buy these upgrades to make new programs ingame
    After purchasing a bit of code the player can then go into the Editor to make a program
    The player can use any number of a bit of code they've bought
    The pieces of code can be bought again to increase it's abilities

### Editor

    - Drag and drop
    - Limited amount of spaces but more can be bought

### Code

    - Increase click power
    - Increase click amount
    - limited for loops
    - Top tier while loops

### Auto Clickers

    - STUPIDLY EXPENSIVE
    - Same idea as a player clicking just auto
    - Seperate code purchases/upgrades
